# Sadpods Docker Container Error

Based on the "Salta" scenario from the phenomenal [Sad Servers](https://sadservers.com), this is an implementation in Gitpod.

## The Activity

There's a container-based NodeJS application in `/home/admin/app`. Build it and run the container on port `8888` that's accessible at `localhost:8888`.

When you can run:

```
curl localhost:8888
```

and receive

```
Hello Pod!
```

You have fixed the problem!
